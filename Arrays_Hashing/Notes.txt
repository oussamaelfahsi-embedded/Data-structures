Parsing and performing operations on an array can indeed be time-consuming, especially if the array is large or the operations are complex.

For Example, Contains duplicate problem,we can solve this problem using many Methods, let discuss 3 methods : 
- Brute Force 
- Sorting
- Hash Set

1- Brute Force : 

by using two loops,we fix the first one at an index and by comparing it with the reset of value we can easly
check wether an element is duplicated or not.
Time & Space complexity of this method : 
 - Time : O(n^2) because of two loops like we parse the array twise 
 - Space : O(1) because no extra space is needed 


2- Sorting
In this method, we start by sort elements of the array so checking wether an element is duplicate or not can be done easily just by comparing the element at index i and elements at index i+1
Time & Space complexity of thi method : 
 - Time : O(nlog(n))
 - Space : O(1) or O(n) depending on the sorting algo

3- Set
Set is a type of data structures that stores no duplicates.
